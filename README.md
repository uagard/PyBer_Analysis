Pyber Analysis
Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to create a summary DataFrame of the Pyber ride-sharing data by city type, and create a multi-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. This written report summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by the decision-makers at Pyber.

Results
The Pyber Summary DataFrame illustrates the following information: The total number of rides is a lot lower in rural cities at 125, and increases five fold for suburban cities, increases 13 times for urban cities. As one might expect, the total number of drivers in rural cities is the fewest, at 78, and increases as populations go up by more than sixfold in suburban and more than thirtyfold in urban cities. It follows that total fares in rural areas are lowest, at $4327.93, increases fourfold in suburban areas, and ninefold in urban areas. The average fare per ride is highest in rural areas at about $34.62, and goes down by about $10 per ride in urban cities. It’s in between in suburban cities, as one would expect. The average fare per driver is highest in rural areas, at about $55.49. One interesting thing I noticed, is that the average fare per driver is so low in urban areas (at $16.57) that it’s even $8 lower than the average fare per ride. The average fare for driver is higher than the average fare per ride in both rural and suburban areas. There are more drivers than rides in urban areas, but more rides than drivers in both rural and urban areas.

Summary
As populations increase, the number of rides, the number of drivers, and the total fares increase, but the average fares per ride and per driver decrease. More people are using the ride-sharing service in cities with higher populations. However, comparing the total drivers and total rides among different city types, it is evident that the demand for rides exceeds the supply in rural and suburban areas. There are riders sitting around waiting for a ride in rural and suburban areas, while there are drivers sitting around waiting for a ride in urban areas.

My recommendations are:
Offer incentives to recruit drivers in suburban areas.
Offer even more attractive incentives to recruit drivers in rural areas.
Offer ride promotions in urban cities.

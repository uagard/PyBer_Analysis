# PyBer_Analysis

Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to create a summary DataFrame of the Pyber ride-sharing data by city type, and create a multi-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. This written report summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by the decision-makers at Pyber.

Results

The Pyber Summary DataFrame illustrates the following information: The total number of rides in the rural cities is at 125, and increases five times for the suburban cities, this number increases 13 times for urban cities. When we look closely at the numbers we notice that the total number of drivers in rural cities is the fewest, there are 78. This number increases as populations go up by more than sixfold in suburban and more than thirtyfold in urban cities. From the data it looks like the total fares in rural areas are lowest, at $4327.93. This number increases four times in suburban areas, and nine times in urban areas. The average fare per ride is highest in rural areas at about $34.62, and goes down by about $10 per ride in urban cities. It’s in between in suburban cities, as one would expect. The average fare per driver is highest in rural areas, at about $55.49. The average fare per driver is so low in urban areas (at $16.57) that it’s even $8 lower than the average fare per ride. The average fare for driver is higher than the average fare per ride in both rural and suburban areas. There are more drivers than rides in urban areas, but more rides than drivers in both rural and urban areas.

Summary

It can be determined that as the populations increase, the number of rides, the number of drivers, and the total fares increase. The average fares per ride, per driver decrease. More people are using the ride-sharing service in cities with higher populations. However, comparing the total drivers and total rides among different city types, it is evident that the demand for rides exceeds the supply in rural and suburban areas. The way the data is set up it would indicate that there could be riders sitting around waiting for a ride in rural and suburban areas, while there are drivers sitting around waiting for a customers to pick up in urban areas.

Recommendations

Find a way to incentivize opportunities to recruit drivers in suburban areas.
Nominate ways to find attractive incentives to recruit drivers in rural areas.
Use ways to offer ride promotions in order to attract more in the urban cities.
